Brute force:

    Approach:
        1. Count the number of zero.
        2. Create an array non-zero elements.
        3. add the number of zero at the end.

Optimized Solution:

    Approach:
        1. Iterate through all the elements.
        2. move non-zero elements to the countZero position in the same array by increating the count by one.
        3. Insert the number of countZero zero at the end.
